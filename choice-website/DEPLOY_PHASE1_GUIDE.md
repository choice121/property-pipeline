## 🎯 2-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Frontend (Cloudflare Pages)
```bash
# Simply push to main branch or:
# In VS Code: Source Control → Commit → Push

# Cloudflare auto-triggers build when you push
# Build command: node generate-config.js (unchanged)
# Result: HTML/CSS/JS deployed to CDN in ~2 min
```

### Step 2: Deploy Database Migration
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
   → Your Project → SQL Editor

2. Click "New query"

3. Copy entire contents of:
   MIGRATION_I069_backfill_orphaned_photos.sql

4. Paste into SQL Editor

5. Click "Run"

6. You should see:
   AUDIT: Found X properties with array mismatches
   VERIFICATION: ✓ All arrays are now in sync

7. Done! ✅
```

**Total deployment time:** ~5 minutes  
**Zero downtime:** ✅ Yes (migration is non-blocking)

## ✨ What Users Will See

### Before → After

**Avatar Upload During Signup**
```
❌ Before: Upload fails silently, account created but avatar missing
✅ After:  Error toast shown, account created, can retry later
```

**Photo Deletion from Listings**
```
❌ Before: Could delete wrong photo if arrays mismatched (silent failure)
✅ After:  Arrays validated before save, always deletes correct photo
```

---

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify these scenarios work:

- [ ] **Signup without avatar** → Normal flow
- [ ] **Signup with avatar** → Avatar appears on profile
- [ ] **Signup w/ avatar, network fails** → Warning shown, account created, can retry
- [ ] **Create listing w/ 3+ photos** → Saves successfully
- [ ] **Edit listing, delete photo** → Correct photo deleted
- [ ] **View ImageKit dashboard** → No orphaned `/properties/` folders with null fileIds

## 📊 Issue Status

### Closed This Session

| ID | Title | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| I-068 | Avatar upload fails silently on signup | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| I-069 | Database array sync validation | 🟠 HIGH |

## 🔍 Code Review Highlights

### Good practices applied:
✅ Explicit error handling (no silent failures)  
✅ User feedback (toast notifications)  
✅ Graceful degradation (signup completes despite avatar fail)  
✅ Defense in depth (both client-side + DB constraint)  
✅ Idempotent database migration (safe to re-run)  

### Testing coverage:
✅ Happy path (signup w/ avatar succeeds)  
✅ Sad path (upload fails, shows error)  
✅ Edge case (network interruption)  
✅ Regression (arrays validated on save)
